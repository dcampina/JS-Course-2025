# 🚀 Learning JavaScript

Hey! I'm currently learning the basics of JavaScript and using this repo to keep track of what I build and practice.

- Mini projects  
- Notes and experiments  

All simple and beginner-friendly — mostly just me figuring things out.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- JavaScript (vanilla)  
- HTML & CSS (for some stuff)
